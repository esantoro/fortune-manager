=head1 NAME

Fortune::Manager - easily manage your own fortunes file(s)

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01 - 19/06/2010
    
This application is born after I got bored at manually adding fortunes
to my own collection of fortunes.

So i decided to create my own application to add fortunes

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Fortune::Manager manages fortune files, easily, automagically.

Perhaps a little code snippet may make its usage more clear:

    manu@joker:~$ fortune-manager 
    [$EDITOR is launched to type the quote]
    adding fortune to your fortunes file...
    manu@joker:~$ 

Simple, neh ?

But it can be more complex, since Fortune::Manager is designed to
handle more than one fortune file.

    manu@joker:~$ fortune-manager fortunes-manu-it
    #add the fortune to the fortune-manu-it fortune file
    
The configuration file is a simple plaintext file in ~, and precisely:
~/.fortune-manager. Maybe in next version it will handle more than one
configuration file.

=head1 Configuration file syntax

As I alredy pointed, the configuration file is a simple plaintext file
in your home, and precisely ~/.fortune-manager

The syntax is pretty simple: each line contains the full path of the
fortune file at the beginning, and other words on the same line are
considered symbolic names (aliases) for the fortune file.

More than one aliases is allowed, but only one is recommended.

At least ONE alias is REQUIRED.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

This module doesn't export any function/method at the time, but I'll
probably extend it for the module to be used in bach-mode.
